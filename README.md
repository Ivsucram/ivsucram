# Hi there üëã Nice to meet you!

Probably I've redirected you here, or you've found me through my contacts. Whatever the case, welcome! Take a look around, and [let me know if you have any questions](mailto:ivsucram@gmail.com). I am looking forward to working with you!

### ‚åö Hours

* I prefer a *hybrid working setting*, where my ideal workweek would have *3 - 4 days in the office*, and *1 - 2 days working home*. I believe that *office hours* are really beneficial for activities where we have to collaborate back-and-forth, while _working from home_ is really helpful for introspective activities, like reading, programming, and similar.

### üó∫ Location

I am currently based in **Singapore**, and I will continue to be for at least 2024 (probably 2027). So let me know if you're in the area, and let's grab some tea.

Previously, I've lived in:

* ‚úàÔ∏è [Bras√≠lia, Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/4BSSY8NWjySruAmo6)
* üåá [S√£o Paulo, Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/QrvaZ5YM8KabGr9VA)
* üçò [Hsinchu, Taiwan](https://goo.gl/maps/T8aLDDXwXu5yZw7aA)
* ü¶Å [Singapore, Singapore](https://goo.gl/maps/hXyvLFGuWEhgTZLRA)

### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...

* **Industrial projects related to the following fields:**
* * Data Science
* * Machine Learning
* * Machine Learning APIs
* * MLOps
* * Web Development
* * Prototyping
* * DevOps

*******

* **My Ph.D. in Machine Learning, where I focus on transfer learning in the multistream environment. You can find some of my projects below**:
* * [ATL: Autonomous Knowledge Transfer from Many Streaming Processes](https://github.com/Ivsucram/ATL_Matlab) - Matlab version
* * [ATL: Autonomous Knowledge Transfer from Many Streaming Processes](https://github.com/Ivsucram/ATL_Python) - Python version
* * Secret Project #1
* * Secret Project #2

*******

* **At the same time, I love video games and related topics**. Although I already have developed some projects in the past, I never uploaded them to Github (that small impostor syndrome that we all have), but this is changing! So following are some personal projects which I am workingon right now, and I hope you can use or collaborate in the near future:
* * [A multi-plataform emulator written in Rust](https://github.com/Ivsucram/ivsemu): Right now there is only Chip-8 emulation
* * A 2D game-engine written in Rust (TODO: git)
